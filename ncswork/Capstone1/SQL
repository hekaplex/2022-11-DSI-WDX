I ended up querying each table as a dataframe since MSSMS kept freezing up when created a database and/or tables with the school's servers.
Below is the last chunk of code I used to do so (I would open the file and make edits depending on what I wanted instead of retyping everything):

import pandas as pd

acct = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\spren\OneDrive\\Desktop\Capstone 1\Details_initial.csv', on_bad_lines='skip')

print(acct.head(10))

print(acct.info()) 

for col in acct.columns:
    print(col)
    
code = acct.groupby(["dsog"])["dsog"].count()

print(code)
