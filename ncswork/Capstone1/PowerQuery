Some of the tables had formatting errors in the actual CSV so I ended up pulling them into Excel to make manual adjustments. The list of those adjustments are as follows:
Deleted empty sname entries
Deleted empty sdestination entries
Replaced sdestination '_' with ''
Split unrecognized Date/Time formatted dteta to seperate times
Reformatted unrecognized Date/Time formatted dteta
Reformatted all dteta to dd/mm/yyyy
Deleted dteta with '9999' dates entries
